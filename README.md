# Prediction and Analysis using SVM
## Project Description:
This project focuses on using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict and analyze a diabetes dataset. The main objectives of this project are:

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

* Handling missing values by replacing zeros with NaN and imputing the missing values using the median of each column.
* Converting data types of relevant columns to appropriate types.


## Exploratory Data Analysis:

* Analyzing the distribution of features using histograms and scatter plots.
* Identifying correlations between features using a correlation heatmap.


## Model Development and Tuning:

* Splitting the data into training and test sets.
* Normalizing the numeric data using StandardScaler.
* Implementing the SVM model and tuning the hyperparameters (C and kernel) using GridSearchCV.
* Evaluating the performance of the best model on the test set.


## Model Evaluation and Interpretation:

* Calculating the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the best model on the test set.
* Analyzing the results and identifying the strengths and limitations of the model.
* Discussing the potential applications and implications of the model in the medical industry.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of SVM for classification tasks, the importance of data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. The insights gained can be used to improve the performance of the diabetes prediction model and support medical decision-making processes.
